This week Nick Bradbury, best known for his products HomeSite and FeedDemon, wrote a short post titled [Code Is Temporary](http://nickbradbury.com/2015/02/25/code-is-temporary/). He talks about the ephemeral nature of code and challenges us to stop wasting our time and build something we care about.

Very little of our code will stand the test of time, lasting decades or more, especially as the evolution of software development continues to accelerate; every week brings new platforms, new languages, new paradigms.

Nick hits it right on the head here: the code we write serves a greater purpose than simply craftsmanship, bringing ideas to life is why we write it to begin with.  

The nature of software development is unique; simultaneously Art and Science, Form and Function. It is difficult, and entirely futile, to craft brilliant code that has no utility.

Ideas are easy, but transforming ideas into reality (however imperfectly manifested) is how we leave our mark on the world. I have spent most of my career seeking out opportunities to be part of something bigger than myself, to create organizations and institutions that will (hopefully) outlive me. I&#39;ve also spent far too much energy and time on projects that I had no love for, doing it for the money (Mortgage Driven Development).

What are you doing that will make a difference? Maybe it&#39;s time for something different.
