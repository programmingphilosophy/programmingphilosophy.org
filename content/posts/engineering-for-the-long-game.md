Astrid Atkinson from Google speaking about [Engineering for the Long Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0jGmgIrf_M&amp;list=PL055Epbe6d5Y86GSg3nhUH3o_v62FGpCI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;app=desktop) at O&#39;Reilly Velocity conference.  

Here are some points that stuck out to me:


*   Your job is not to limit growth. When you&#39;re trying to keep complexity in check, one of the worst things you can do is say &#34;You can&#39;t launch this, it&#39;s too complex, it&#39;s going to make things worse&#34;
*   You want to be enabling all the growth the product can provide.
*   You need to get out of the business of managing machines.
*   It&#39;s not about the system you are using, it&#39;s about getting it so your engineers can run their own services.
*   Keep an eye on what&#39;s costing time, and consider &#34;cost&#34; broadly
*   In a stateless system, doing something is better than doing nothing.
*   Somewhere between 1 and 5 identical systems you need to figure out where you are going to take a stand
*   If your second system doesn&#39;t unlock new capabilities, don&#39;t do it
*   Move the biggest customer first. &#34;If you want to build a race car, there&#39;s no point in starting with a cardboard box&#34;
*   Look for what&#39;s costing you &#34;trouble&#34;
*   There&#39;s no finish line, it&#39;s an infinite game.
*   It&#39;s easy to get fixated on little decisions, like where to put the config files. As long as you put them in a roughly organized place, you&#39;ll be ok.
