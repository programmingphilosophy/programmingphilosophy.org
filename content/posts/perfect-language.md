I had some conversations recently about the “perfect language,” I found this great quote from Yukihiro Matsumoto, father of Ruby:  

 



Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, &#34;My language is perfect. It can do everything.&#34; But it&#39;s just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language—how we feel while programming.  

   

Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore. From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ—but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.  

   

Instead of emphasizing the what, I want to emphasize the how part: how we feel while programming. That&#39;s Ruby&#39;s main difference from other language designs. I emphasize the feeling, in particular, how I feel using Ruby. I didn&#39;t work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it&#39;s not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.



   

Also a bonus on humanity of programming:  

 



Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, &#34;By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.&#34; They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.
