From [http://threevirtues.com/](http://threevirtues.com/)  

According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris  

**Laziness**: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don&#39;t have to answer so many questions about it.  

**Impatience**: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don&#39;t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.  

**Hubris**: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won&#39;t want to say bad things about.
