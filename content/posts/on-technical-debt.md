Nina Zakherenko gave a great talk at PyCon 2015 called [Technical Debt - The Monster in Your Closet](http://www.slideshare.net/nnja/pycon-2015-technical-debt-the-monster-in-your-closet) that you need to watch.  

Go ahead, watch it. I&#39;ll wait...  

...  

Great! Hope you enjoyed it.  

That got me thinking about where the term came from. In 1992 Ward Cunningham said:


> 
> Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite... The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-oriented or otherwise.

Technical Debt is a powerful metaphor, Ward gave an [in-depth interview](http://www.ontechnicaldebt.com/blog/ward-cunningham-capers-jones-a-discussion-on-technical-debt/) exploring the metaphor that is very interesting.  

   

How does Technical Debt affect your work? What are you doing to minimize it?
