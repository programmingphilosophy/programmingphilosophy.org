[Michael Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Jackson) on Optimization:


1.  Don&#39;t.
2.  Don&#39;t Yet (for experts only).


  

Donald Knuth in [Structured Programming with Goto Statements](http://pplab.snu.ac.kr/courses/adv_pl05/papers/p261-knuth.pdf):


> 
> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

Before you send me hate mail, he finishes that thought up with

The real trick is knowing if you are the 97% or the 3%.
